Templates for NTTS abstracts and papers
---

This is a _"working repo"_ for the preparation of templates for the [NTTSS conferences series](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/content/ntts-conferences_en). 

Official templates, *i.e.* final versions to be used for submission, can be found on the conference website, *e.g.* [**2021 NTTS templates**](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/content/NTTS2021_en#section-3)  for instance.
